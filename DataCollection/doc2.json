    "text":"When Apple launched macOS Catalina, one of the biggest changes that users had to get used to is the fact that iTunes no longer exists. Instead, Apple launched several apps that is essentially iTunes, but broken up into individual apps to help make the experience less bloated, where there would be a dedicated app just for music, one for videos, and so on. We had previously heard that those changes would only be for macOS Catalina and that iTunes for Windows would remain as it is for now, but it looks like Apple could be looking to change that in the near future. According to a report from Neowin, they have spotted what appears to be a job listing posted on LinkedIn in which it hints that Apple could be looking to introduce an iTunes successor to Windows. The job listing calls for a software engineer to develop the “next generation of media apps for Windows”, where its description reads, “If you love music and you are passionate about writing code, and want to work with world-class engineering teams that ship to millions of users, the Media Apps team is the place for you.”",
