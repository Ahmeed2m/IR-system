    "text":"Alibaba Group (BABA) was founded by Jack Ma, who remains the company’s CEO, and 17 others in 1999. At its core, the Chinese company is an ecommerce giant made up of many online platforms that offer consumer-to-consumer (C2C), business-to-consumer (B2C), and business-to-business (B2B) services. However, Alibaba is also involved in many other kinds of business.\n\nAlibaba is often likened to Amazon (AMZN); while the two companies are similar, it's important to know how they differ. Both companies are among the world’s largest, based in ecommerce and extremely diversified. But unlike Amazon, Alibaba itself is not a retailer. Instead, Alibaba’s network of interlocking platforms merely facilitate ecommerce between manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, and customers.\n\nAlibaba is massive. By some estimates, it already controls around 80% of all online retail sales in China. In 2014, Alibaba made history with its $25 billion IPO, the highest ever. It is now one of the 10 most valuable companies in the world, the fifth largest internet company in the world, and in Jan. 2018 it became the second Asian company to be valued over $500 billion, after Tencent Holdings. On June 5th, 2019, when Alibaba released its annual report and 20-F, it had a market capitalization of $397.8 billion. The company has a current ratio of 1.3 and a return on equity (ROE) of 13.2%.",
