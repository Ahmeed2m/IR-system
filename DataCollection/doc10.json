    "title":"Apple AirPods Pro Review: Practically perfect",
    "text":"Loose fit that can't make a perfect seal? Have some silicon tips and take Apple’s new fit test. No active noise cancelling? These AirPods have powerful ANC. Weird-looking design? All right, it's still weird-looking, but the stem on these AirPods is shorter.\n  Priced at a premium $249, the AirPods Pro answer nearly all the criticisms of its predecessor while raining on Amazon's, Sony’s (and everyone else's) parade. Apple crammed in three microphones, a powerful audio driver and made it all come together in a pair of buds that feel like magic. Yes, the battery life could be longer. But the AirPods Pro are officially the best wireless earbuds you can buy and are among the best best headphones overall.",
