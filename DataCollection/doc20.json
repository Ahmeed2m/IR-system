    "text":"Mohamed Salah was born in Basyoun on June 15, 1992. Just 17 years later, he was making his first-team debut for Arab Contractors. Here, Mo opens up on his early years and explains how he broke into professional football…\n\nI first fell in love with football when I was a kid, around seven or eight years old. I remember watching the Champions League all the time and then trying to be like the Brazilian Ronaldo, Zidane and Totti when playing out in the street with my friends. I loved those kinds of players, players who played with magic.\n\nI’d also play football with my brother, but he’s not that good! Well, not as good as me! But I also had all of my friends always playing football, so I’d play with them too. I have an older friend and he’d always tell me, ‘you will be a big player one day’. He was my best friend back then and even now, he’s still my best friend to this day.\n\nIt was when I was 14 that I first signed with Arab Contractors (El Mokawloon) and my career in the professional game began – but it was a tough time for me.",
