    "text":"One of the features of the Apple Watch is the SOS feature, where it is similar to the SOS feature on the iPhone where users will be able to quickly call for help and reach emergency services. This is exactly what a couple of kayakers did when they found themselves stranded in the sea after their kayaks sank and they were not wearing lifejackets.",
