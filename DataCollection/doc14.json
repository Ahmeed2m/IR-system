    "text":"Uber Technologies (UBER) explosive growth and constant controversy made it one of the most fascinating companies to emerge over the past decade. The firm, founded in 2009, soon grew to become the highest valued private startup company in the world. \n\nRapid Growth\nWith Uber's rapid growth came many controversies that knocked down the firm's valuation from a lofty $70 billion to $48 billion in its last funding round in Jan. 2018. On May 23, 2018, the company announced a new tender offer that would bump the company's value to $62 billion.\n\nEarlier in 2018, Japanese conglomerate Softbank Group, along with a group of investors including Dragoneer Investment Group, successfully bid for 20% of Uber's stock at this lower valuation, a 30% discount of the last valuation figure. The deal reportedly gave Softbank 15% in the rideshare company while Uber got a powerful ally in Asia, and could help turn the tide for the company after a few very public missteps. The remaining 5% of shares reportedly went to other investors in the group. The year hasn't been all great, though, as a self-driving Uber vehicle was involved in a fatal crash. Additionally, on August 8, 2018, the New York City Council voted to put a pause on new licenses issued to ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. ",
