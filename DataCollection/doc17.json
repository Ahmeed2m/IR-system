    "text":"In 2004, a group of friends at college created an innovative new social media platform with the aim of connecting Harvard students through an online community.\n\n14 years later, Facebook is one the most influential social networks in the world, boasting approximately 2.2 billion monthly users.\n\nSo how did a social network created in the confines of a Harvard dorm room go from being a student trend to an unprecedented, worldwide phenomenon?\n\nIt all began in 2003, when Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg created an online programme called “Facemash”, which allowed users to objectify fellow students by comparing photos of their faces and selecting who they deemed as “hotter”.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg faced punishment from the Harvard administration and narrowly escaped expulsion from the college altogether for his actions, “Facemash” provided the framework for what was to become Facebook.\n\nOnline “face books” already existed at Harvard at the time. These were online directories that featured photos of students alongside some information about them.\n\nThere wasn’t a single “face book” for the whole student body of Harvard university, which is why Zuckerberg came up with the idea to create one.",
