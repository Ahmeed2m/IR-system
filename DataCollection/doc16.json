    "text":"Shikabala joined the youth academy of Zamalek SC when he was 10-years-old and made his first team appearance in a cup match early in 2002,[2] scoring the winning goal at the age of 16. He remained with the first team squad since then but had very limited playing time and no professional contract, which is why he was able to leave Zamalek and join PAOK FC in January 2005 for no transfer fee. He enjoyed one relatively successful season with PAOK; however, despite the Greek club being adamant that Shikabla would remain at the club until the end of his contract in 2009,[3] he subsequently returned to Zamalek for the 2006â€“07 season to fulfill army duty in Egypt.[2]",
