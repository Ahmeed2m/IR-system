    "text":"The Apple Watch is the best smartwatch you can buy. Sure, it's pricey, but these days finding the best Apple Watch deals isn't as hard as it used to be. \n Retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target have been offering some of the best Apple Watch deals throughout 2019. And although Black Friday and Cyber Monday are now behind us, it's still possible to find cheap Apple Watch prices.\n If you want the cheapest Apple Watch possible, look no further than the Apple Watch Series 3. Although the Apple Store sells it for $199, it hit an all-time low of $129 on Black Friday. It packs many of the same features found in Apple's newer models, including built-in water/dust resistance. Keep in mind that this is the cheapest Apple Watch deal you'll find, so retailers have trouble keeping it in stock.",
